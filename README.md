## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
According to [Science.gov](https://open.science.gov/), "open science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity."

In general, the main features of the concept of open science can be identified as being: `1)` accessible, `2)` reproducible, and `3)` inclusive, as shown in the schematic below adapted from [Ramachandran, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001562).

In this repository, we compile a list of guidelines and resources to aid researchers aiming to contribute to open science. These guidelines and resources include recommended practices for sharing datasets, software tools or code, experimental protocols, results, and research preprints or papers.

## Our Contributions <a name="contributions"></a>
In the [LejeuneLab](https://sites.bu.edu/lejeunelab/) at Boston University, we have generated, curated, and disseminated a number of datasets relevant to two main applications: 

`1)` machine learning methods in mechanics
`2)` high-throughput analysis methods for image-based data in cardiac tissue engineering

Our main goal is to provide benchmark datasets for both applications where the number of publicly available datasets is limited. Furthermore, with this endeavor, we aim to make data-driven problems in mechanics and in cardiac tissue engineering more accessible to the broad research community.
