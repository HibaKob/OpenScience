## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
According to [Science.gov](https://open.science.gov/), "open science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity."

In general, the main features of the concept of open science can be identified as being: `1)` accessible, `2)` reproducible, and `3)` inclusive, as shown in the schematic below adapted from [Ramachandran, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001562)

In this repository, we compile a list of guidelines and resources to aid researchers aiming to contribute to open science. These guidelines and resources include recommended practices for sharing datasets, software tools or code, experimental protocols, and research preprints or papers.

## Our Contributions <a name="contributions"></a>
In the [LejeuneLab](https://sites.bu.edu/lejeunelab/) at Boston University, we have generated, curated, and disseminated a number of datasets relevant to two main applications: 

`1)` machine learning methods in mechanics

`2)` high-throughput analysis methods for image-based data in cardiac tissue engineering

Our main goal is to provide benchmark datasets for both applications where the number of publicly available datasets is limited. Furthermore, with this endeavor, we aim to make data-driven problems in mechanics and in cardiac tissue engineering more accessible to the broad research community.

For the first application, we have compiled a list of [open-access mechanics datasets](https://elejeune11.github.io/) generated by our group and by others. In addition to the host link, we include links to the codes used to generate and implement the dataset by the developing group, as well as the manuscript describing the work in more details. Finally, we include a "recommended challenge" for most datasets as a starting point for novice users to start exploring the dataset.  

For the second application, we have published 3 datasets relevant to cardiac tissue engineering based on time-lapse microscopy images generated by our collaborators at Boston University and at the University of Michigan. We chose [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) as the hosting site.

* [Engineered cardiac microbundle time-lapse microscopy image dataset](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5x69p8d8g)

* [Strain gauge platforms: Time-lapse microscopy dataset of engineered cardiac microbundles](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sqv9s4nbg) 

* [FibroTUG platforms: Time-lapse microscopy dataset of engineered cardiac microbundles](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3r2280gqd)

Through this work, we have come across a number of useful resources that serve as a good starting point for anyone who is planning to make their work publicly accessible and likewise, contrubite to open science.
