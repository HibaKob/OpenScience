## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
According to [Science.gov](https://open.science.gov/), "open science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity."

In general, the main features of the concept of open science can be identified as being: `1)` accessible, `2)` reproducible, and `3)` inclusive, as shown in the schematic below adapted from [Ramachandran, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001562).

In this repository, we compile a list of guidelines and resources to aid researchers aiming to contribute to open science. These guidelines and resources include recommended practices for sharing datasets, software tools or code, experimental protocols, and research preprints or papers.

## Our Contributions <a name="contributions"></a>
In the [LejeuneLab](https://sites.bu.edu/lejeunelab/) at Boston University, we have generated, curated, and disseminated a number of datasets relevant to two main applications: 

`1)` machine learning methods in mechanics

`2)` high-throughput analysis methods for image-based data in cardiac tissue engineering

Our main goal is to provide benchmark datasets for both applications where the number of publicly available datasets is limited. Furthermore, with this endeavor, we aim to make data-driven problems in mechanics and in cardiac tissue engineering more accessible to the broad research community.

For the first application, we have compiled a list of [open-access mechanics datasets](https://elejeune11.github.io/) generated by our group and by others. In addition to the host link, we include links to the codes used to generate and implement the dataset by the developing group, as well as the manuscript describing the work in more details. Finally, we include a "recommended challenge" for most datasets as a starting point for novice users to start exploring the dataset.  

For the second application, we have published 3 datasets relevant to cardiac tissue engineering based on time-lapse microscopy images generated by our collaborators at Boston University and at the University of Michigan. We chose [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) as the hosting site.

* [Engineered cardiac microbundle time-lapse microscopy image dataset](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5x69p8d8g)

* [Strain gauge platforms: Time-lapse microscopy dataset of engineered cardiac microbundles](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sqv9s4nbg) 

* [FibroTUG platforms: Time-lapse microscopy dataset of engineered cardiac microbundles](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3r2280gqd)

Through this work, we have come across a number of useful resources that serve as a good starting point for anyone who is planning to make their work publicly accessible and likewise, contrubite to open science. 


## Recommendations <a name="recomends"></a>
In general, it is advisable to consult [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), which are guidelines to optimize the `F`indability, `A`ccessibility, `I`nteroperability, and `R`euse of digital assets, for effective curation and dissemination of research products. 
As a rule of thumb, make sure that the online platform through which the work is shared can provide permanent links such as DOI-based links. In addition, it is important to choose permissive licenses for shared data and code to maximize the benefit other researchers will obtain from the published work.

### Recommendations for curating and disseminating datasets
For sharing datasets in specific, we found it very useful to keep the following in mind when collecting and preparing the dataset for dissemination: 

1) Make sure to keep track of metadata. Include as much information as necessary that would allow other researchers to reproduce the entire dataset if needed. 
2) Be mindful of data organization. It is a good practice to put yourself in place of a potential user and think of an efficient folder structure to receive the data. In other words, present your dataset in a way that makes it readily implementable.
3) Make sure that the data (and labels if available) is saved in file formats suitable for your data type and readable by all operating systems. For example, text `.txt` files, comma-separated value `.csv` files, and Tagged Image File Format `.tiff` images could all be suitable formats. Also, avoiding formats that require licensed software to be read aligns with the notion of open science.
4) Avoid large file and folder sizes. This will make it easier for other researchers to sample your dataset and check if it is suitable for their application. Smaller file sizes are also more convenient for researchers around the world with suboptimal internet speeds.
5) Choose an online platform that best suits the type of data in your dataset, its potential users, and its overall size. Institutional repositories, when available, are always a great choice. Other popular options include [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and [figshare](https://figshare.com/).


### Recommendations for publicly sharing software tools or code
Regarding open-access software or code, there are also a number of practices that make developing computational tools more straightforward to build and share, and, on the other end, easier to download and use. Below are key points to consider:

1) Build your code 

platform: GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, Bitbucket
adaptable code
code testing and coverage
use open-source programming language
documentation, installation guide, tutorial
rubber duck:  rubber duck debugging  or confessional programming. 

### Recommendations for publicly sharing experimental protocols
No experience with this but 
protocol.io

### Recommendations for publicly sharing research preprints or papers
make sure journal you are submitting to are okay with this
open-access and possibly open-review journals 
arXiv, bioarXiv,
